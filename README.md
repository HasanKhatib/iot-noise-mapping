# IoT-Based Noise Pollution Mapping

## Project Overview
This project aims to **collect, analyze, and visualize noise pollution** using **IoT sensors (Arduino RP2040, ESP32) and AI-based data analytics**. The goal is to help cities better understand urban noise levels and provide insights for **urban planning, public health, and smart city applications**.
